## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 15: Leaflet Challenge

In this module, we learned how to utilize Leaflet to make interesting map-based visualizations. For this challenge, we used data found on the USGS website for recently reported earthquakes and marked them on a map of the world. The size of the marker corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake, and the color corresponds to the depth of it. When you click on a point, you will see a pop-up that includes information such as the locatin of the earthquake, as well as the magnitude and depth.
